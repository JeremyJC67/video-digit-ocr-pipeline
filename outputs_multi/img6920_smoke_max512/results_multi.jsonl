First, I need to find the measured temperature from the green controller at the bottom. Looking at the image, the green display has \"Measured Temp: -132.10°C\". So the value here is -132.10, which we need to round to two decimal places? Wait, the example in the output format has -132.1, but the actual value is -132.10. Wait, the problem says \"read the number in degrees Celsius (it can be negative and can have decimals)\". So the value is -132.10, but the example output has -132.1. Wait, maybe the decimal is just to be precise. Let me check the image again. The green display shows \"Measured Temp: -132.10°C\". So that's -132.10. But the example output in the problem statement is {\"measured_temp_c\": -132.1}, but maybe the actual value is -132.10. Wait, no, the problem says \"read the number in degrees Celsius (it can be negative and can have decimals)\". So we need to take the exact value. Let's see: the text is \"-132.10°C\", so that's -132.10. But maybe the problem expects rounding to one decimal? Wait, the example output has -132.1, which is one decimal. Wait, maybe the image shows -132.10, so we can write -132.10, but the example output is -132.1. Wait, maybe the problem's example is just an example, but we need to check the actual value. Let's look at the green display: \"Measured Temp: -132.10°C\". So that's -132.10. But the problem says \"read the number\", so we need to take the exact value. Wait, maybe the decimal is part of it. Let's move on to the second part. Second part: the chamber pressure labeled 'BC/O' on the top monitor. Looking at the top monitor, there's a list of values. The row for 'BC/O' is in the right side. Let's check the text. The top monitor has a list of values, and one of them is 'BC/O' with the value 4.33e-004 mbar. Wait, the problem says \"Find the row whose label is exactly 'BC/O'\". Let's check the top monitor. The text says: \"BC/O 4.33e-004 mbar\". Wait, the example output has \"bc_o_mbar\": 4.33e-4. So that's 4.33 × 10^-4, which is 0.000433. But the example output is 4.33e-4, which is correct. So the value for BC/O is 4.33e-4. Wait, let's confirm. The top monitor's right side has a list of values.

Let's check the text. The top monitor's right side has a list. The user says: \"the row whose label is exactly 'BC/O'\". Looking at the text, there's a line that says \"BC/O 4.33e+000 mbar\".

The top monitor's table: looking at the list, there's a row with BC/O, and the value is 4.33e-004. Let me check again. The user specified to not use IGPc1 or IGPco, so BC/O is the one.
