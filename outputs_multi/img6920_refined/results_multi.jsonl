But the example output in the problem statement is -132.1, but maybe the actual value is -132.10. Wait, the problem says \"read the number\", so we need to take the exact value. Let's confirm: the line is \"Measured Temp: -132.10°C\", so the number is -132.10. But the example output in the problem statement is -132.1, but maybe the problem expects rounding to one decimal?

First, I need to find the measured temperature from the green controller. Looking at the bottom image, the line \"Measured Temp:\" shows \"-132.10°C\". So that's the value for measured_temp_c. Then, for the BC/O pressure, I need to check the top monitor. The top part has a table with entries like BC/O. Let's look at the right side of the top monitor. The row labeled BC/O has the value 4.33e-004 mbar. Wait, the problem says to find the row exactly 'BC/O', so I need to confirm that. The top monitor's table: looking at the list, there's a row with BC/O, and the value is 4.33e-004. Let me check again. The user specified to not use IGPc1 or IGPco, so BC/O is the one.
